# Satellite-Image-Classification
This repository is about multiclass classification on satellite images.

Sea levels are rising every year. The terrain, the vegetation, and cloud formation all undergo significant changes when the water level rises.
As a result, it is vital to look for changes over time in satellite photos. This project focuses mostly on classifying satellite photos.

The collection comprises of 5631 satellite photos divided into 4 classes: overcast areas, green areas, deserts, and water bodies.

A predictive model based on satellite photos is what this research aims to produce. According to the image's pixel values, this project assists in categorising the photographs. Convolutional neural networks, which make up the bulk of this model's design, are developed using the TensorFlow library.


CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. In essence, then, as we all know, it's a machine learning technique that enables computers 
to anticipate the image's properties and memorise them so that they can determine whether to provide the machine the name of a new image.

The model's accuracy is 97%. Therefore, I think this model can accurately forecast satellite photos.
